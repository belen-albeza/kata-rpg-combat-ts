# kata-rpg-combat-ts

Step-by-step implementation of the RPG Combat kata in TypeScript, following an Object-Oriented approach and applying SOLID principles.

See [KATA.md](./KATA.md) for the kata instructions. There's also a [step-by-step commentary](https://ladybenko.net/notes/rpg-combat-kata-typescript/) in my website.

## Requirements

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the TypeScript runtime. You need to install it into your system in order to run the project.

To **run** the kata:

```zsh
bun start
```

To run the test suite:

```zsh
bun test
```
